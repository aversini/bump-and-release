> Bump and Release is a tiny command line helper to bump and release packages.

## Installation

```sh
> cd your-project
> npm install --save-dev bump-and-release
```

## Configuration

Update your `package.json` file with the following scripts calls:

```json
"scripts": {
  "bump": "bump-and-release -t bump",
  "release": "bump-and-release-t release"
}
```

If you are using a configuration file, you can pass it via the parameter `-c`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "bump": "bump-and-release -t bump -c ./config/app-config.js",
  "release": "bump-and-release-t release -c ./config/app-config.js"
}
```

Or if you name it `.bump-and-release.config.js` and put it in the same location as your `package.json` file, it will be taken into account automatically.

This:

```json
  "bump": "bump-and-release -t bump -c .bump-and-release.config.js"
```

is equivalent to:

```json
  "bump": "bump-and-release -t bump"
```

if the file `.bump-and-release.config.js` can be found next to your `package.json`.

## Bump

By default, the "bump" command will:

1. Run the following preflight validations
   - check if the current branch name is `master`
   - check if the current branch has a tracking remote
   - check if that remote is `github/master`
   - check if your repo has uncommitted files
1. Prompt the user to choose from a list of possible "new versions"
   - patch
   - minor
   - major
1. Update your `package.json` file with the new version
1. Update your `package-lock.json` file with the new version
1. Stage and commit those files
1. Push to the tracking remote

If any of those tasks fail, the process stops.

## Release

By default, the "release" command will:

1. Run the following preflight validations
   - check if the current branch name is `master`
   - check if the current branch has a tracking remote
   - check if that remote is `github/master`
   - check if your repo has uncommitted files
1. Stage and commit any modified files
1. Tag the version with the following template: `vCurrentVersion`
1. Push code and tags to the tracking remote

If any of those tasks fail, the process stops.

## Custom configuration

While the defaults are pretty straight forward, it is possible to override them with a configuration file.

### Example

   */

   * Configurations specific to the "bump" command.
   */

     * { boolean }

     * local, preventing anything to be pushed.
     */

     * { function }
